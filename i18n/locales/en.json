      "content": "AI is moving faster than a scooter weaving through Taipei traffic. While global models are incredibly powerful, they often feel disconnected from our daily lives—speaking to us in a way that’s technically correct but culturally distant. \n\nWe believe Language is Life—it’s the soul of our identity. But without AI that understands our local nuance, the way we speak risks being washed away by generic data. At Twinkle AI, we’re here to bridge that gap. Since 2025, we’ve been curating local data and refining models with a single mission: to build an AI that actually \"gets\" us—one that feels natural, intuitive, and authentically local."
