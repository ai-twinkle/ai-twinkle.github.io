The 3B-parameter open-source model **F1**, co-developed by Twinkle AI and [APMIC](https://www.apmic.ai/), was invited to serve as the testing foundation for **XecGuard**, the latest AI security technology from **[CyCraft](https://www.cycraft.com/)**. Through live-fire stress tests, we demonstrated the exceptional resilience of local models when paired with security fine-tuning modules against malicious attacks.
