**"This recognition belongs to every single contributor."**

Twinkle AI made its debut at the IT Matters Awards, organized by the [**IMA (Information Manager Association)**](http://ima.org.tw/), and was honored to walk away with the **Open Source Community Contribution Award**. This win was sparked by our deep collaboration with **Taiwan Mobile** on open-source projects, where we compiled and submitted our collective results from earlier in the year.

Standing alongside veteran communities like **PyCon** and **SITCON** at the award ceremony was a massive boost for us. It’s more than just a trophy; it validates our technical efforts and marks a solid step forward in our mission to build a local AI ecosystem.

"This trophy belongs to every partner. Because of you, our community received this recognition. The glory goes to all of you. Enjoy!"

After connecting with many experienced communities at the event, we’re reminded that Twinkle AI is still very young. This award is an opportunity to reflect on our future—how we can tackle challenges like **talent retention** and **knowledge transfer** while building more resilient partnerships that keep our technical energy alive.
