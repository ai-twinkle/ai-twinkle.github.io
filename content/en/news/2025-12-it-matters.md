> "This Win belongs to Every One of You"

Twinkle AI just hit a major milestone at the **IT Matters Awards**, hosted by the [**IMA (Information Manager Association)**](http://ima.org.tw/). We’re incredibly proud to take home the **Open Source Community Contribution Award**. This achievement was driven by our tight collaboration with **Taiwan Mobile** on open-source initiatives, where we joined forces to turn months of hard work into a winning submission.

Sharing the stage with veteran communities like **PyCon** and **SITCON** was a massive reality check and a huge confidence boost. This award isn’t just a trophy; it’s a validation of our technical grind and a bold step toward our goal of building a resilient, local AI ecosystem.

> **"This trophy belongs to every single partner. Your energy is why this community was recognized. The glory is all yours. Enjoy it!"**

Connecting with so many OG communities reminded us that Twinkle AI is still just getting started. This win gives us the momentum to tackle the real challenges ahead — figuring out **talent retention**, streamlining **knowledge transfer**, and building the kind of deep-rooted partnerships that keep our technical energy alive.
