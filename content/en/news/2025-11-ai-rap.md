We showcased our technical results at the **TAIWAN AI RAP** event organized by the **NSTC** and **NARLabs**. In collaboration with [**Chen-Si Studio**](https://utunote.com/), we demonstrated Taiwan’s first small-scale reasoning model, proving that edge-device AI has massive potential for everyday logic and tasks.
