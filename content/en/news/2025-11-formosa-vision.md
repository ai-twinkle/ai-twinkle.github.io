The Twinkle AI team officially unveiled **Formosa Vision**, a project designed to address the cultural blind spots of global Vision Language Models (VLMs). We curated thousands of image-text pairs from the **National Cultural Memory Bank**, applying precise Data Cleaning and linguistic calibration to ensure AI can accurately recognize unique Taiwanese landscapes—from historic trails and military housing (眷村) to the battlefields of Matsu.
