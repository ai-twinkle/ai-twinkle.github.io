### Turning Passion into Protocol

January 2026 marked a **defining moment** for Twinkle AI. This wasn’t just an anniversary; it was our first official physical meetup — the day we took our technical syncs out of Discord and **turned our online energy into real-world impact.**

#### Our Evolution: From Feedback to Framework
We originally hit the scene as **Llama Taiwan** on January 2, 2025, with a simple mission: gather feedback for the Llama-3.2-Taiwan model. But as the community grew, so did our ambitions. We quickly evolved into a dedicated technical hub for Traditional Chinese AI models, bringing together the brightest minds to build out the local open-source ecosystem.

#### 70+ Strong: A Community Without Borders
We initially prepped for 40 friends, but **70+ passionate partners** showed up. Seeing members travel all the way from Kaohsiung to Taipei just to talk tech — that’s the kind of community spirit that keeps us going.

#### Event Lowdown:
* **The Roadmap Ahead:** We looked back at a year of collective building and laid out the blueprint for where we’re heading next.
* **Beyond the Screen:** We finally turned those Discord avatars into real-life collaborators, building the kind of deep-rooted partnerships that can't be forged through a screen.
* **Lightning Talks:** From deep-dives into model training to the latest in AI Agent implementation, our contributors showcased the raw technical expertise that defines this community.

A massive thank you to everyone who’s been part of this journey. We’ve faced our fair share of challenges, but the people who stayed are here because they believe in the power of open source. Every breakthrough we've achieved is the result of **collective grind** — a foundation built by the hands of every single contributor.
