January 2026 marked a major milestone for Twinkle AI. This wasn’t just a birthday; it was our first official physical meetup, taking our technical syncs from the Discord server and **turning our online passion into real-world action.**

#### Our Roots and Evolution

We started as **Llama Taiwan** on January 2, 2025, initially to gather feedback for the Llama-3.2-Taiwan model. As more people joined, we quickly evolved into a dedicated technical community for Traditional Chinese AI models, bringing together minds for various open-source projects.

#### Unexpected Enthusiasm (40 vs. 70)

We expected 40 friends; we got **70+ passionate partners**. We even had members travel across the country from Kaohsiung to Taipei—that’s some serious community spirit.

* **Event Highlights：**
  * **Milestones & Roadmap：** We walked through the community’s journey over the past year—sharing what we’ve built together and giving a sneak peek into where we’re heading next.
  * **Beyond the Screen：** Through face-to-face interaction, we turned our online avatars into real-life partners, building genuine collaborations that go beyond the Discord server.
  * **Lightning Talks：** From model training to Agent implementation, our members shared deep-dives into the tech that powers our community, showcasing the real-world expertise of our contributors.

A huge thank you to everyone who contributed over the past year. We’ve had our challenges, and while some have moved on, many more of you stayed because you believe in the power of open source. Every milestone we’ve reached is a result of our **shared efforts**—a foundation built by the hands of every single contributor.
