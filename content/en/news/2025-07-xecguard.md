**CyCraft** and **APMIC** entered a strategic partnership to unveil **XecGuard**, the industry's first defense-oriented AI security module. Powered by a proprietary multi-stage fine-tuning process (**SFT+GRPO**), this "plug-and-play" solution provides essential security for AI systems, helping organizations defend against malicious attacks during localized deployments.

In technical trials, the R&D team used **F1 (Formosa-1)**—the 3B model co-developed with Twinkle AI—as the testing benchmark. Verified through **LLM Red Teaming**, the results demonstrated exceptional defensive capabilities:

* **Measurable Security Boost**: Overall security scores increased by an average of **19.4%**, with specific attack scenarios showing up to a **33.9%** improvement.
* **Outperforming Global Models**: The F1 + XecGuard combination significantly outperformed international commercial models, including **Llama 3B**, **Gemma 4B**, and **DeepSeek 8B**, in security resilience.
* **Precision Defense**: Effectively counters threats like **Prompt Injection** and **Prompt Extraction** while maintaining high-quality responses for essential tasks.
