In collaboration with **APMIC**, we introduced **Formosa-1**, Taiwan’s first 3B reasoning model capable of running on mobile devices. Leveraging **Model Distillation** and **Taiwanese Chain-of-Thought (TCoT)** data, we significantly enhanced the model’s performance in legal reasoning and logical deduction.

Alongside the model, we launched **Twinkle Eval**, an open-source evaluation framework. By implementing massive parallel testing and randomization, it ensures stability across local benchmarks like **TMMLU+** and specialized legal datasets, providing a fairer and more precise standard for Traditional Chinese AI development.
