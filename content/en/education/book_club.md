**Stripping It Down to the Studs**

In this reading group, moving beyond just flipping pages means taking theory apart to see what makes it tick. Systematically deconstructing **"Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)"** provides a real handle on the foundations before ever writing a single line of code.

Translating dense technical concepts into digestible, community-driven notes happens in every meetup. It’s about clearing the path from raw theory to actual understanding, ensuring the underlying logic is transparent for everyone involved.
