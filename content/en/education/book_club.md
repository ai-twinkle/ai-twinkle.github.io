**Deconstructing the fundamentals.**

We are currently studying **"Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)"**. We don't just skim the pages; we deconstruct the content and synthesize it into accessible notes during our online sessions.

This is a space for sharing insights. We discuss implementation details and clarify confused concepts together, aiming to help everyone understand the logic behind the code. If you want to understand LLMs from the ground up, you are welcome to join us.
